    "# Welcome to the Introduction to R Workshop \n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop is intended to serve as an introduction to the R programming language for those with little to no experience in its use. \n",
    "\n",
    "## In this workshop you will learn:\n",
    "- Basics of R (objects, variables, data classes, vectors)\n",
    "- How to write R functions \n",
    "- How to import and export your own files \n",
    "- How to install and load R and Bioconductor packages\n",
    "\n",
    "### This workshop uses JupyterHub, which provides an environment to run Jupyter notebooks for Python, Julia, R, and other languages without the need to install any software or packages. Two helpful shortcuts:\n",
    "- Shift + Enter to run a cell and move to the next cell\n",
    "- Press 'b' to create a cell below (won't work if you cursor is showing up inside the cell itself).\n",
    "- See other shortcuts here https://towardsdatascience.com/jypyter-notebook-shortcuts-bf0101a98330.\n",
    "\n",
    "### If you want to continue using R outside of a Jupyter notebook, you'll need to install R - https://www.r-project.org/ and optionally Rstudio - https://rstudio.com/.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is R?\n",
    "- R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics (https://www.r-project.org/about.html). \n",
    "- It is free and can be tailored to your needs by installing and using specific packages (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html).\n",
    "- You can use R interactively (e.g., enter commands into the R console or R Studio https://rstudio.com/) or into new cells in your Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "- You can write and run R scripts or generate reports and documents using R notebooks (https://blog.rstudio.com/2016/10/05/r-notebooks/) and markdown files (https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)."
